The "takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given" threw me. I could see that
there was only one arg being passed.

First result of Googling that error leads to a Stackoverflow page describing
someone else's exact confusion at this.

While I've been practicing working with objects it's not to the point that I 
know them well.

This is the kind of error that a person with a little more experience would
have caught immediately and I think I learned a lot from this very simple error.
