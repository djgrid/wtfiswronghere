When I saw the error I had my suspicions that the problem was that when you 
import a module you need to call a function you need to either use 
module.function() or explicitly import the function (from function import module)
otherwise you'll get this error. 

I did an exact phrase Google search on the error and got a Stack Overflow page
confirming that.
