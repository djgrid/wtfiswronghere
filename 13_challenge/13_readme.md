Ran the script and the error suggested a missing closing quote on a string and
my editor confirmed that.

I fixed that error and also noticed the missing colon in the for loop and 
corrected that as well.

I re-ran the script and found that there was a typographcal error in the 
function call - fizzbuzzy as opposed to fizzbuzz. 

Corrected that and reran the script successfully.
