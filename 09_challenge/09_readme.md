The script seemed to run okay when I rean it but then I noticed that the 
filename of the screenshot told me what to look for.

I figured the writers here were going to be nice and put the problem somewhere 
easy to find so I checked at the beginning and noticed that the first fizz 
and buzz were missing.

Took a look at the code and saw the bad range() call.
